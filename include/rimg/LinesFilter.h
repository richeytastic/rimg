/**
 * Lines found in the 2D colour image (e.g. using Hough Transform) are only lines
 * in 3D if the depth along their length varies linearly (within certain bounds).
 *
 * This class takes a vector of 2D lines and sorts them according to the likelihood
 * that they actually represent a line in 3D by comparing the rate of change of depth
 * along their length with the change in depth in the associated linearly scaled range image.
