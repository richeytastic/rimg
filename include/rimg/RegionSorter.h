/**
 * Finds an ordering of region maxima in a "response map" generated from the
 * sequential addition of rectanglular areas of different dimensions and
 * positions in the map having different values. The response map is an
 * aggregation of these values over their respective rectangular bounding
 * regions. Finding the maximum region takes O(log N) time (where N is
 * the (square) dimension of the response map). Normally, finding the
 * maximum value takes O(N^2) time.
