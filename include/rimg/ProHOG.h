/*
 * Computes Proportional Histograms of Oriented Gradients (Pro-HOG) descriptors over an image:
 *
 * The image is tiled into cells (not necessarily square) of dimension proportional to the image
 * dimensions. A histogram of length N (default 9) is associated with each cell. Each bin of this
 * histogram represents a discretised orientation and the continuous value of each bin represents
 * that orientation's magnitude.
 *
 * Horizontal and vertical point derivative convolution masks are used to iterate over every
 * pixel in the image and the orientation and strength of the pixel is calculated. The pixel
 * orientation strength is used to soft bin between that orientation bin and the two bins either
 * side of it. At this stage, each pixel gets its own set of orientation bins. This is represented
 * by an integral image of the same number of channels as bins. Additionally, all orientation
 * magnitudes are summed over the pixel and placed into a second integral image which will be
 * used during normalisation.
 *
 * Once all pixels have been parsed, the cell dimensions can be defined as a proportion of the
 * image dimensions. Final construction requires pixel histograms to be summed over cell regions.
 * This is accomplished using the first integral image. The sum of each orientation value for
 * a cell is then normalised in four different directions w.r.t the four blocks of 2x2 cells
 * that overlap this cell. Normalisation uses the L1 norm of the block of cells (i.e. the L1 norm
 * of the concatenation of the four cell histograms) for each orientation bin in the target
 * cell's histogram. The four cell normalisations are then concatenated into a 4*N vector for
 * that cell. Finally, the dominant direction of the Pro-HOG descriptor is found and the vector
 * shifted so that the most dominant direction is at the initial index (helps with invariance
 * to rotation).
 *
 * The original HOG descriptor was introduced by Dalal & Triggs in "Histograms of Oriented
 * Gradients for Human Detection" (in proceedings of CVPR 2005). As presented by D&T, the
 * algorithm was empirically tuned for the detection of humans in 2D images using a SVM
 * classifier.
 * 
 * Note that pixel orientations cannot be calculated over the first/last row/col of the image
 * using pixel centred derivative masks (<-1,0,1> (horizontal), and <-1,0,1>^T (vertical)) so
 * the orientation values at these extremes are calculated using the shorter convolution masks
 * of <-1,1> (horizontal), and <-1,1>^T (vertical). Additionally, because each cell is created
 * to include information about the cells around it, Pro-HOGs at the edges of the image will be
 * less reliable than the Pro-HOGs further inside the image.
 *
 * As part of the initial processing of the image to find the pixel first order derivatives,
 * square-root gamma compression is performed to help improve tolerance to lighting issues.
